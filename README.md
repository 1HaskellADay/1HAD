# 1 Haskell A Day exercises

This project provides a git support for 1HaskellADay's exercises
(see [@1HaskellADay|http://twitter.com/1HaskellADay])

## Getting started

- Find an exercise in the `src` folder (there is one in the `Exercise.hs` file
  of each "leaf/date folder").  For example, the first one is in
  `HAD\Y2014\M02\D24\Exercise.hs`
- Do it.
- At the root of the project, run `ghci`.
- check your answer with `check`. For exampel here: `check `2014 2 24`
- compare your answer with the proposed one (in the `Solution.hs` file)
